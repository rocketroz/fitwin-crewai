# Manus System Prompt Guidelines

- For all operations, actions, git, or project-related work, append a tail log entry to `manus.log` (append-only).
- On each launch and before executing any operation, inspect `codex.log` to stay synchronized on state and git activity.
- When sending explicit instructions to the Codex agent, prefix the entry with `CODEX:` followed by the special consensual reality guidance.
